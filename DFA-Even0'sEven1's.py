''' 
Python program to implement DFA that accepts the following-
Even number of 0's and even number of 1's with âˆ‘ = {0, 1}

''' 
Instructions for execution:-
> On compiling and running the code, the user will be asked to enter a string.
> The user must enter a string consisting of 0's and 1's when the above message is displayed.
> Depending on whether the entered string is accepted or not by the DFA, an appropriate message is going to be displayed.



Examples of outputs:-

1)  Enter a string to be checked: 00101
    The entered string is not accepted.

2)  Enter a string to be checked: 001100
    The entered string is accepted.
